# Figures-drawer

## Prerequisites

- Java 14
- Maven

## Overview

This is my pet project „Figure Drawer“ that allows the user to draw any figure on a console (for example any kind of
triangles, or a rectangle or even a house) with just knowing a size of a figure - all the calculation and actual drawing
is done by the program itself.

For now the drawing is happening in the console. But the service is written in a way that it can be easily expandable to
also have a UI interface.

## Goals

To develop step-by-step architectural (design) solutions that solve the task “draw a house”, 
where each subsequent level becomes progressively more efficient, has less lines of code, and is more maintainable.

Each level increases the level of abstraction and applies system-design and architectural patterns, 
gradually moving from raw imperative logic to a declarative, pattern-driven approach.

### Step 1 — drawHouseLvl0(size)
  - Uses a raw imperative algorithm with deeply nested loops and direct System.out.print calls 
  - No reuse, no separation of concerns: drawing logic and printing mechanics are fully coupled 
  - The method is large, monolithic, and difficult to modify or extend
  - **~70–90 lines of actual logic**

### Step 2 — drawHouseLvl1(size)
  - Introduces a drawing service abstraction (PatternDrawerService)
  - Low-level printing is encapsulated into reusable operations:
    - printDottedLine(...)
    - printSolidLine(size)
  - Still relies on explicit for loops to express repetition and symmetry 
  - Improves readability and reduces duplication, but control flow is still manual
  - **~20–25 lines of actual logic**

### Step 3 — drawHouseLvl2(size)
  - Replaces most loops with pattern-based drawing primitives
  - Repetition is expressed declaratively via:
    - printDottedLines(count, dot(...), dot(...), …)
  - Introduces parameterized dot deltas to encode iteration rules inside reusable methods 
  - The method becomes a sequence of what to draw, not how to iterate
  - **~7 lines of actual logic**

### Step 4 — drawHouseLvl3(size)
  - Moves to a coordinate-driven, geometry-aware API 
  - Uses explicit anchor points:
    - point(x, y)
    - printDottedLinesEx(count, point(...), point(...), …)
  - Drawing logic is expressed in terms of structure and symmetry, not iteration 
  - HouseDrawerService acts as a high-level orchestrator; complexity lives in the drawing engine
  - **~4 lines of actual logic**

## Main classes

1. Pattern - a core class, containing methods - atomic „patterns“, from which any figure can be potentially built.
   Already optimised for building complicated lines.
2. Drawer - a higher level abstraction above Pattern class. Used for building actual figures using patterns from Pattern
   class.
3. Runner - a „starting point“ of our application, where we just specify what kind of figure we want to draw.
   Each class is developed using Client-Service pattern: For example a Runner class is a client, 
and a DrawerService is its service, and DrawerService itself is also a client for PatternService class.

## Why this project

I intentionally chose this „simple“ topic for a project with a minimum business logic, because I wanted to focus on a
technical richness of the project rather than showing off in richness of business features. My goal here was to focus on
deepening my knowledge in a programming language Java, design patterns and engineering practices.

## Technologies that were used

- Java features
    - OOP ???
    - Inner, nested classes
    - Stream API
    - Call chaining
- Design patterns:
    - Builder
    - Factory
    - Strategy - for testing purpose
    - Singleton (was eventually removed from the project)
    - To be added: Unit tests, using input/output Stream
- Maven for managing dependencies
- JUnit 5 for tests
